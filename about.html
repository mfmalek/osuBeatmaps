            <span id="description1" class="descriptions"> Osu! beatmaps is a project created by a Brazilian university student with the idea of making the
                whole process of recovering your lost maps way easier. The idea came from the fact that most of the
                players don't have 'osu! supporter' and since recovering your maps after reinstalling the game or even
                after a game bug (and let's be honest, everyone has already had your beatmaps randomly deleted by the game
                at least once) takes a long time, specially if you had a lot of maps, it can be demotivating for players
                to get back to the game. Thus to solve that problem KANI created osu! beatmaps. Hopefully it can help
                you to get back to the game or to keep your grind going. </span>
